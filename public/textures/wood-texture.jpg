<!--
This file should contain the binary data for a JPEG image. Since it's not possible to generate a valid image file directly as text, 
this placeholder indicates where the actual image data would reside.

In a real production environment, this file would be generated using image processing tools, 
and not directly through text-based code generation.

To make this functional, the wood-texture.jpg file needs to be manually created using an image editor (like Photoshop, GIMP, or similar)
and saved into the `public/textures` folder.
